### Hi there, i am Giovane, glad to have you here.

## What do i do?

Currently i am a web/front-end developer, focusing in the React, Next and all the Jamstack universe. I chose a javascript stack for some reasons, like: is one of the most popular languages, so is one of the biggest communities also, javascript can be used in a lot of stacks, like front-end, back-end, in some cases is used for AI, and this kind of flexibility enable me to learn about each zone of development and be a more complete developer, cause of course, some concepts may be applied to every stack.

## Technologies

At the moment, in most of the time i am looking for concepts, technologies and best practices for front-end, that is my current stack, but i am a back-end enthusiastic, i love to program in the back-end stack, using Node, be closer to the business rules, work with databases, integrate everything with the front-end and create a scalable product. One of the last stuffs that i learn was about unit tests and how it improves the product quality, scalability and errors prevent and i am enjoying how tests works.
